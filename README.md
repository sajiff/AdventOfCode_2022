# AdventOfCode_2022

My solutions to the Advent of code 2022 problems. This is my first time attempting the challenge and my goal is not to win anything but to go through the challenge and try my best to solve all the puzzles.

I might try to improve my codes but my first priority is to solve the question as quickly as possible and get to the right answer. My code might not look the brightest but I'm happy as long as it gets me the answer.

## Language used: Javascript

## Note:

Inside each puzzle folder I have a dummy.txt file which holds the data that was given as an example input to the puzzle. I used that to make sure my code works and then moved to data.txt which holds the actual puzzle input.
